Hi! I'm an aspiring Asian American web developer from the east coast. I enjoy working on various projects in open source, communication, and social dynamics.

I'll jump at any chance to hike, jam guitar, paint or rock climb. Also obssessed with self-help, alan watts and my dog Baxter! 

I currently study Computer Systems Engineering at RPI in Troy, NY.
