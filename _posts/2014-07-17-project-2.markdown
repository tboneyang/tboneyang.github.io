description: Feed.io is a real-time chat system focused on ease of use, productivity, collaboration, and security. <br> <br> The motive behind this project was to address the significant shortcomings of current communication workflows. We realized our communication activities were fragmented across a mismatch of unique interfaces - at the very least one client for IRC, one for video, and another for audio. Some of these technologies worked great in specific use-cases but fell short in practice. As developers, we noticed none of our solutions allowed us to have a simple IRC-like chat experience, while providing us with basic features such as syntax highlighting, file sharing, or Push-to-Talk (PTT) audio streams. Even worse, most of the alternatives were not open-source, could not be self-hosted, and lacked modern cryptographic encryption schemes to ensure secure conversations. <br><br> Feed.io is currently implemented as a text-based platform with intuitive topic threading features. Code and Links are also separated for the user's convenience. Other features include read receipts, notifications, chat rooms, and many more.<p>The original source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/tboneyang/feed.io">here</a></p> <br> <img src="img/portfolio/feed1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"></img> <br> <img src="img/portfolio/feed2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"></img> <br> <img src="img/portfolio/feed3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"></img>
