My friend Arya and I began this project during a HackUpstate, a hackathon at Syracuse during the fall of 2014. This application provides a platform for anyone to submit a challenge and for random people to accept those challenges through video submissions.

For example, a user may write, "Burp the Alphabet." Through Ziggeo API incorporation, users may easily submit video's of their burping and allow other users to comment/upvote their submissions.

This way, everyone will know who reigns supreme in the weirdest of skills/talents you can only find on the internet!
