Meep aims to bring a well-designed communication platform for businesses who would benefit greatly from automatic code, link, and topic threading. My partner, [**Alex Freska**][alex], began the project our sophomore year at Rensselaer. He wrote the chat system using the socket.io WebSockets framework.

Since designing a rudimentary system where users send and receive messages through different channels, other features have been implemented to compete with modern chat systems such as Facebook's. Time, read-receipts, topic-tagging, and code/link highlighting. The site filters messages with Markdown delimiters and uses Highlight.js to differentiate code snippets. URL's are also popped into a seperate feed so users can keep track of shared links.

The next big goal of this project is designing a system to pop out topics or questions out of a main thread and make a new channel dedicated just to that specific task. Hashtagging is implemented right now, but it's still not as intuitive as what I have in mind.
