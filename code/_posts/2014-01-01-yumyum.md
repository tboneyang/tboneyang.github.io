YumYum was started by myself and my roomate, Arya Seghatoleslami, in the fall of my senior year at Rensselaer under the mentorship of Rensselaer's Center for Open Source Software.

This Ruby on Rails app aims to gather all free food events on campus through user submissions and email, twitter scraping. The web app allows users to navigate available events and links to google-maps to find them. Users can comment, upvote, downvote and share events.

The next big goal of this project is designing an RPI specific event scraping system. Currently, the club activities feeds don't provide the information that we need. To pursue this matter further, we aim to access personal club emails and scrape them for data instead.

The original source code can be found [**here**][node].
