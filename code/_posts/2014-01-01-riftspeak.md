League of Legends requires intense communication at higher levels of play; however, solo-queue players still lack a primary tool for voice communications. Skype and TeamSpeak may work; however, they lack a much needed anonymity. They also require the installation of software.

RiftSpeak aims to resolve this issues. Competing applications include Curse Voice, Talk.gg and a few other browser-based chat tools. Curse Voice led the market through endorsement by famous streamers and pro players; however, they required software downloads and the mass incorporation of their product by many users.

My roomate, [**Alex Freska**][alex], and I sought to implement a browser chat tool that also facilitated the champion-select process in game. In the lobby stage, our website helps users build effective team comps by providing space to see different champion selections together. We hoped to use Riot's API to incorporate win rate statistics as well. 

There were problems with gaining 100% user connection rates, and they are explained [**here**][noob]. Though, overcome, these issues require coordination with the company Vline for a fee far too great for this application's purpose. The project was abandoned for now; however, we may consider re-trying once WebRTC technology reaches certain future checkpoints.
