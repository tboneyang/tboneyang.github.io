In college I noted that successful Tinder users tended to be very attractive people in the first place; it was not a dating app meant for everyone. Many stay unmatched! The virtually unlimited amount of options for the Tinder users seemed to take emotional intimacy completely out of the equation.

This is where Sweethearts excels. In my app, every user is limited to three "hearts." A user may hold onto his/her hearts or give them to a friend, but there will only be 3 at a time in circulation from any one user. Once a heart is given to someone, the person accumulates a point on their user dashboard;however, the identity of their admirer remains anonymous until there is mutual agreement from the two to reveal their identities to each other. This is done through the enabling of text chat. This is a social twist to many confession pages.

In this limited context I imagine that users won't give hearts out to the most attractive person, but perhaps the person they genuinely like the most. Individuals will be rewarded for kind and considerate behavior as their "heart" points will climb, sparking a popularity contest on most college campuses that adopt this app.

Future aspirations of the app include functionality to include "celebrity hearts" where users can give out 3 celebrity hearts. I imagine interest in seeing Justin Beiber/Miley Cyrus going toe to toe in these contests. Another interesting feature would be enabling couples in faltering relationships to evalute the social value of their significant other, and make decisions based upon these points.
